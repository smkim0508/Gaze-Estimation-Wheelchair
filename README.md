# Gaze-Estimation-Wheelchair
An ongoing project to develop a wheelchair fully-automated using gaze estimation.

Allows users to freely control a powered wheelchair via their occular motor functions (eye movement and focus) without the use of their hands. Aimed to provide individuals with lower body and hand impairment with a method of movement and communication. 

# Methods
The method is composed of an autoencoder-based reconstruction model and GazeMLP linear layers for final infernece. 

The overall architecture is shown below:
